# WHAT IS CLOUD COMPUTING?

The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer

**local** describe as being on-premise, being your own office of your own Data Center. This is where you own the servers, hire the IT people, you pay the rent or real estate, you take all the risk 

Whereas with a **cloud provider**, if you're utilizing them, it's someone else who owns the servers, someone else who hires the IT people, someone else who pays to rents the real estate and you are only left with the responsiblility of configuring your cloud services and code and someone else takes care of the rest.
