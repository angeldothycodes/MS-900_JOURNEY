- **If you really want to get to the data you've got to go through all the steps here. These are all the layers of defense.**

- **I just want to give extra emphass to "Identity and Access" because this one's the most outer one besides the physical security so they would say something like the modern perimeter is defined based on your identity.**

- **Another things is that even though the perimeter layer says it provides distributed denial of service protection to filter large scale attacks and so on, this is actually a bit misleading. The DDoS Protection Standard provides multi-layered protection when deployed with a web application firewall, it should protect both at the network layer and at the application layer emphasizing especially on the network layer.**
